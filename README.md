# Deprecation Notice

**The [EventBus](https://github.com/LaxarJS/laxar/tree/master/lib/runtime/event_bus.js) is now fully integrated into [LaxarJS](https://github.com/LaxarJS/laxar).**
If you are interested in a standalone version, please let us know! (For example, by [filing an issue](https://github.com/LaxarJS/laxar/issues/new) in the LaxarJS project.)

For details on _what this thing is_ and how it is used, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/LaxarJS/laxar/blob/master/docs/manuals/events.md#the-event-bus) in LaxarJS.
